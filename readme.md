# 1. feat, add ParkingLotManager
```
## Background
As a Parking Manager, I have employed three Parking Attendants to help manage these parking lots, each utilizing a specific parking strategy:
1. Standard parking strategy -> `SequentialStrategy`
2. Smart parking strategy -> `MaxAvailableStrategy`
3. Super Smart parking strategy -> `AvailableRateStrategy`

## Requirement
Assist me in implementing the `ParkingLotManager` class.

## Rules
1. Strictly adhere to the current design.
2. Ensure your code is free from code smells.
3. The code should be scalable and maintainable.

## Additional Instructions
1. Provide explanations in Cantonese.
2. No need to add comments; just ensure that naming conventions clearly express functionality.
```
# 2. test, add test cases for ParkingLotManager
```
## Requirement
Help me to create unit test cases for the `ParkingLotManager` class.

## Rules
Ensure your code
1. following the format Given/When/Then
2. with high coverage
3. have no code smells
4. be concise, e.g. using @ParmeterizedTest
```
# 3. feat, add dto for fetch, park
```
# Requirement

each utilizing a specific parking strategy:
1. Standard parking strategy -> SequentialStrategy
2. Smart parking strategy -> MaxAvailableStrategy
3. Super Smart parking strategy -> AvailableRateStrategy

# Your task
You're implementing three api (fetch, park, get all parking lots)

# Your current task
Based on the current code, implement the dtos for fetch request and park request
fetch request: plateNumber, position, parkingLot 
park request: plateNumber, strategyNo

# Rules
- Modular design
- No code smells
- Maintainable and scalable architecture
```
# 4. feat, add controller + refactor, update manager to support controller
```
